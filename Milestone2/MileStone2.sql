The school is established on a strong and sound foundation of core values and ethics, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement. We do not only teach core subject matter, but also focus on life skills. We prepare our students for a new tomorrow: one in which critical thinking and problem solving skills will be crucial for their success. All pupils are valued as individuals. Confidence and self-esteem, which are essential for success, are actively nurtured and developed.

The ISEE curriculum extends beyond the requirements of the American, British and IB curricula and is carefully structured to provide a varied balance of subjects that will release the potential in each student. The small number of students in each class leads to the close monitoring of the students'' academic progress, in addition to identifying and addressing problems at an early stage. See Less'),
