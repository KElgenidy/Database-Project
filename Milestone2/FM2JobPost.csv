“WorldFish is a leading international research organization working to transform aquatic food systems to reduce hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. It collaborates with international, regional, and national partners to co-develop and deliver scientific innovations, evidence for policy, and knowledge to enable equitable and inclusive impact for millions who depend on fish for their livelihoods. As a member of CGIAR, WorldFish contributes to building a food- and nutrition-secure future and restoring natural resources. Headquartered in Penang, Malaysia, with country offices across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, WorldFish strives to create resilient and inclusive food systems for shared prosperity. 
For more information, visit: www.worldfishcenter.org” 
Background of the Project
In June 2023, WorldFish has partnered with the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Cairo to initiate Center for Renewable Energy in Aquaculture (CeREA) project. A 4-year groundbreaking initiative to refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable 5,000 fish producers, processors, and other fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and incomes, leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more energy-efficient and climate-smart food value chains.
Center for Renewable Energy in Aquaculture (CeREA) key interventions seek to:
Refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and income leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more adaptation to energy-efficient and climate-smart systems.
 
Deployment of appropriate renewable energy technologies for aquaculture, along with efficient planning ad capacity building for scaling the Egyptian aquaculture sector in a sustainable, climate-friendly and inclusive manner to support both economic growth and protein needs of the country’s rapidly expanding population.
 
Consultancy objectives
:
Development of a gender-sensitive assessment tool which has to consider intersectionality through integrating socio-economic inclusion across multiple dimensions of the Egyptian aquaculture value chain
 
Identify critical factors that limit women and youth participation, engagement and highlighting viable pathways to ensure that (CeREA)’s selected innovations for piloting and scaling are strongly integrating gender and social inclusion across different project outputs.
 
Identify opportunities for women and youth empowerment along the Egyptian aquaculture value chain, with considerations to climate-change constrains.
 
Design of a gender-sensitive and inclusive strategy for (CeREA)’s 4-years strategic implementation.
 
Scope of Consultancy:
WorldFish seeks to hire a gender and social inclusion international consultant. S/he is to join another two consultants in designing and developing a baseline study that shall addresses solutions for optimizing renewable energy solutions aimed at tackling key challenges within Egyptian aquaculture value chain.
The mentioned-study requires development of key instrumental surveying tools that mainly focus on:
Carrying out a gender assessment for analyzing gender and social inclusion gaps, challenges and opportunities using (Micro, Meso and Macro) analyses among other tools (e.g. S.W.O.T analysis).
 
Integrating gender and youth specific approaches to enhance social inclusion dimensions for increasing their participation in (CeREA)’s different activities (e.g. entrepreneurship opportunities for women processors, fish retailers and small-scale farmers).
 
Piloting at least two or three gender transformative approaches (GTAs) in the research cites to determine the best GTA approach that can be scaled to advance the work of promoting the use of climate-smart and renewable energy in the CeREA project.
 
Submission of a preliminary report of key-findings and results that have been carried out under the baseline survey of the study for the gender equality and social inclusion domain of the project.
 
Development of (GESI) strategy, gender-sensitive assessment tool that will be mainstreamed across the project key interventions until 2027 and submission of consultancy final technical report.
 
The consultant is expected to become familiar with project outcomes and outputs through a desk review of project key documents (e.g. logical framework, factsheet, etc.). (He/She) will work directly with the baseline study consultants, MEL and survey local consultants and WorldFish.",null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They work closely with front-end developers, database administrators, and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the application or system.
Job Description:
1. Developing Server-Side Logic: Backend developers write the code that powers the core functionality of an application or website. They handle tasks such as data storage, manipulation, retrieval, and processing. This involves programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js, depending on the technology stack used.
2. API Development: Backend developers design, develop, and maintain APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different software components to communicate with each other. This includes creating RESTful or GraphQL APIs, defining endpoints, and implementing data transfer protocols.
3. Database Management: Backend developers work with database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to design and optimize the database architecture. They write queries, ensure data integrity, and handle performance optimization to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
4. Integration of External Services: Many applications rely on external services like payment gateways, cloud storage, or third-party APIs. Backend developers integrate these services into the application, ensuring seamless communication and functionality.
5. Security and Performance Optimization: Backend developers play a crucial role in ensuring the security and performance of an application. They implement security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). They also optimize the application for speed and scalability, considering factors like caching, load balancing, and efficient algorithms.
6. Collaboration and Documentation: Backend developers collaborate with cross-functional teams, including front-end developers, UX/UI designers, and project managers. They participate in code reviews, provide technical guidance, and document their work to facilitate future maintenance and troubleshooting.
7. Testing and Debugging: Backend developers are responsible for writing unit tests and performing debugging to identify and fix issues. They also work with quality assurance (QA) engineers to ensure the overall quality of the software.
To excel as a backend developer, you should have a strong understanding of programming languages, databases, data structures, and algorithms.

Automate wherever possible
  Mundane tasks take up more time than you realize. If you can eliminate the simplest of daily tasks, you will have more room for making improvements.
Overcommunicate  When
 it comes to the health and stability of your network, there is no such thing as overcommunicating. Make sure that everyone has access to information needed to 
troubleshoot

Establish a single source of

looking at the same data and information
